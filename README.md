Good day!

Welcome to my GitHub. My name is Svyatoslav Rogozin, and I am the creator of this repository.

This repository is a logical continuation of the Stations repository. You can check it out [here](https://svyatoslav-stack.github.io/Stations/).

Here, the data is updated every 30 minutes (plus GitHub Pages delay) and resets at 00:00 of each new day (GMT+2).

[Enjoy it!](https://svyatoslav-stack.github.io/Stations_30min_Pulse/)
